# Create-a-Maze

The most challenging part of this assignment for me was to assign the correct interaction layer to the controllers and to each interactable objects in the game. There are some instances where I accidentally did something wrong and the ray indicator would flicker making it very difficult to interact. I didn't know what went wrong but I assume it must be some conflicts in the interaction layers. Fortunately, I was able to start from scratch and fix the problem the second time.
